# Patient-Logger

## Background
Patients with chronic pain or other neurologic conditions frequently note that their symptoms vary with environmental conditions. This includes heat and light but also body position and level of activity. It would be useful for the patient and their physician to know how these factors influence their main symptoms such as pain, fatigue, or weakness. This might allow the patient and their physician to build a treatment plan that mitigates these environmental factors.

## Approach
In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to have a platform that can log a few variables in addition to a patient input about how they are feeling. All of the parameters can be logged at a low data rate (<1/sec). For each patient depending on the clinical condition a different set of sensors may be chosen based on the clinical consideration. The most common might be the orientation of the back, pelvis and maybe upper legs in patients with back pain. In patients this might be an averaged surface EMG and in others might be skin surface temperature and environmental temperature. The patient input should be very simple maybe just a dial or dial plus a button that is also recorded at the same time as the sensor data. Once this data is collected there needs to be a system to download the data generate graphs of symptoms vs time and symptoms as a function of sensor readings.
